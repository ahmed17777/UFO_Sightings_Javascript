## Overview 

In this project, I will be creating a webpage and dynamic table using Javascript and Bootstrap that provides an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple search criteria using a dynamic table that uses event listeners to update search results when they are inputted by the user. 

## Results 

After creating the intial webpage in the module, the first task at hand was to add the new search parameters that will filter results in our table.
